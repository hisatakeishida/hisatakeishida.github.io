Hello! I am Hisatake (Take) Ishida, PhD candidate at the University of Queensland. Supervised by Associate Professor Cheong Xin Chan and Professor Cynthia Riginos.

The overarching aim of my PhD is:

**To investigate compositional and functional diversity of microbes in Great Barrier Reef using hologenomics and metagenomics!**

More specifically, I am investigating biodiversity and functional potential of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae) in reef-building corals and free-living microbial communities in coral reef sediments across the Great Barrier Reef.
