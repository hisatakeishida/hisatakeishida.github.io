    "text": "Hello! I am Hisatake (Take) Ishida, PhD candidate at the University of Queensland. Supervised by Associate Professor Cheong Xin Chan and Professor Cynthia Riginos.\nThe overarching aim of my PhD is:\nTo investigate compositional and functional diversity of microbes in Great Barrier Reef using hologenomics and metagenomics!\nMore specifically, I am investigating biodiversity and functional potential of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae) in reef-building corals and free-living microbial communities in coral reef sediments across the Great Barrier Reef."
