Supervised by Associate Professor Cheong Xin Chan and Professor Cynthia Riginos.\nThe overarching aim of my PhD is:\nTo\nWill coral evolution be able to keep pace with climate change?\nThe results suggest that outcomes are likely to vary across the GBR, with an increasingly pessimistic outlook for all coral communities if we fail to reduce our carbon emissions in the near future. The models I am building currently using explicit genetics and size-dependent dynamics share this result!"
